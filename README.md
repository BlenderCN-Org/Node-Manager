# Node-Manager

Manages Blenders Material Nodes (clean up etc)

Current Features:

* Remove a Node from the Graph's Flow, delete it but try to keep the connection between the Node inputting and outputtin into/from it
* Clear unused Nodes. If a Node's outputs arent used its useless, so why use it? Deletes all unused Nodes

   Marking a Node as "muted" will save it from being deleted
